# Regression-Problem
In this problem, the task is to predict the current health of an organism given the measurements from two biological sensors measuring their bio-markers. With this data, we try our linear regression models on the training data and report the following metrics on the test split: (a) Mean Squared Error, (b) Mean Absolute Error.

Here, we are expected to predict the lifespan of the above organism given the data from three sensors. In this case, the model is not linear. You are expected to try several (at least 3) non-linear regression models on the train split and report the following metrics on the test split (a) Mean Squared Error, (b) Mean Absolute Error

Dataset:File p1,p2-train.csv to train the model and p1,p2-test.csv to test the model. Last column is the target value.

Models to use: Suppot Vector Regression, Linear Regression (Use this for both the regression problem) 3
